    course for at least £100 or a 14 hour for at least £100 everyone would go for the 10 hour for the exact same price but he would
    go for the less time.

    chosen technologies have helped you achieve
    your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan
    and how can git and GitHub help with your codes
    version control<br>
    A version of controls allows you to keep track of all of your work and helps you easily to explore the changes that you
    have made, be it data, coding scripts, notes and etc.

    1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that
    impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact
    digital projects? <br>
    One of the primary objectives of GDPR is adjusting the legal regulations concerning the processing and protection of
    personal data to better fit the challenges of technological development and globalization which have facilitated the 
    unprecedented availability and pervasive use of personal data. Just to be clear, by&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;I mean any information
    relating to an identified or identifiable natural person—including identifiers such as a name, an identification number,
    location data, an online identifier, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
    economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

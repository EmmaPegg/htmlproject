<h1>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each
page<br>

<h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints
    affecting websites<br>
    the copyright and the other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish. The best way to get around this is first,get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.
